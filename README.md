So today was WWDC 2014. Apple announced a range of things, but the one all the developers are talking about is Swift.

Swift is their new programming language to replace (or work alongside) Objective-C and C.

I'm following along their [online guide](https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/the-swift-programming-language/id881256329?mt=11) and learning it. I decided to create a GitHub repo for me to dump the sample project I'm working on to do it.
